# claude-guard

One Python package for Claude Code Bash permission decisions. Slice 1 ships the segmenter
and the CLI; the judge, the rules loader and the hook shims are later slices of the spec in
`docs/specs/2026-09-06-claude-guard-design.md` (dotfiles repo).

## The segmenter's contract

`claude_guard.segment.parse(command)` returns a `Parsed` whose `status` is `ok` or
`unreadable:<reason>`. **A non-ok status is a refusal, never a skip.** A caller must defer
(PermissionRequest) or ask (PreToolUse); it must never read it as "nothing to worry about".

On `ok`: `segments` are the top-level commands in order, each with the separator that
terminated it (`&&` `||` `;` `|` `&` `newline` `eof`), its lifted heredoc bodies, and whether
each heredoc delimiter was quoted. `substitutions` holds the content of every `$( )`,
`` ` ` ``, `<( )` and `>( )`, flattened across nesting. This is a port of `cmdparse.sh`'s
awk pass and agrees with it field for field (`tests/test_vectors.py`), except that the bash
`heredoc` field cannot represent an empty body; `_comparable` in `cli.py` drops empty bodies
on both sides.

## Running

    claude-guard explain 'git status && ls & rm -rf /'
    claude-guard replay commands.jsonl --compare-bash ~/.claude/hooks/cmdparse.sh
    printf '%s' 'ls; pwd' | claude-guard segment --json

## Tests

From this directory, under uv's managed 3.14, without writing a `.venv` into the source tree:

    PYTHONPATH=. uv run --no-project --python 3.14 --with 'pytest>=8.0' pytest -p no:cacheprovider -q

`tests/python-suites.test.js` at the repo root runs the same command as part of `node --test`.
